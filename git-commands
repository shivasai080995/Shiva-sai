our code is already push in GitHub now we need to undo the particular commit in this scenario we can use revert command
git log --oneline
git revert --> it is used for when we have commit the code that code changes undo and create new commit id it does not disturb previous commits	
git revert commit id
git revert HEAD 
git revert HEAD~N
git revert commit id --no-edit --> not opened vi editor and direct created new commit-id
------------

git reset commit id --> undo the code and delete previous commit history and does not created commit-id and added previous data in this commit-id
does not delete previous data with deleted commit id data and  all data in workspace

git reset HEAD
git reset HEAD~2
git reset --soft commit id --> changes undo to workspace does not delete anything
git reset -- mixed --> undo the changes to staging area 
git reset --hard commit id --> delete previous commit and delete data also
